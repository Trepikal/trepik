# trepik-mobile

Codebase for Trepik's ios and android application (possibly web platform, but we'll see.)

## Running It
You will need Android Studio and Xcode installed on your device to follow these steps. 
### Android
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open the configure menu and navigate to "AVD manager" to create a new Android Virtual Device--recommend you use the one with Pie because I know that one works. Once configured, start the AVD and ensure that the emulator opens.
3. Open the configure menu and navigate to Plugins to add the Flutter and Dart plugins. 
4. Click "Open a project" In the start menu and navigate to the location of Trepik Mobile on your machine. (note: Open the entire project, not just the android directory.)
5. Run the Application from android studio on the emulator with the run button. It takes time for the Gradle to build, but you should be off the ground! 

You don't need to restart the application anymore. Simply save your changes and the app will automatically rebundle. 
### ios
Who even knows... 

Yesterday, the steps were
1. Point to Project file 
2. Run project on emulator
3. All done! 

Today, emulators didn't work, signing was out of wack in a whole new way, managed to register my device with apple, so I just don't know anymore.

So anyway, good f-ing luck to you.
